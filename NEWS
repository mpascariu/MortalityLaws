version 2.1.2
- update web source for Australian Human Mortality Database;

version 2.1.1
- provide anchors to all documented external \links{};

version 2.1.0
- replace several stop errors with messages so the failure to connect to databases (for whatever reason) results in a gracefull ending of the process and to avoid triggering CRAN random error;

version 2.0.3
- Change interaction with external resources and update documentation;

version 1.9.9
- fix hmd links and add more messages in case of failure to connect to external
sources;

version 1.9.3
- fix minor bugs, links and dois

version 1.8.5
- make the function using Internet resources to fail gracefully with an
informative message if the resource is not available or has changed.

version 1.8.1
- LifeTable(): fix minor bug that prevented the closing of the life table with
a qx = 1 in some situations;
- Updata internal unit tests.

version 1.8.0
- readCHMD(): New function useful to download the Canadian Human Mortality Database;
- readAHMD(): New function useful to download the Australian Human Mortality Database;
- readJMD(): New function useful to download the Japanese Mortality Database;
- convertFx(): improve the speed of the function > 5x;
- availableHMD(): improve the speed of the function  > 100x;
- LifeTable(): the argument 'ax' now accepts as input a numerical vector as well allowing the
user to decide the timing of occurrence of death in each age interval;
- Update LICENCE: MIT. Drop GLP-3.

version 1.7.0
- New models: Kannisto-Makeham (1998) and Strehler-Mildvan (1960);
- ReadHMD() new functionalities. The function can now download cohort life tables, cohort life expectancy and exposure-to-risk by Lexis triangles data.

version 1.6.0
- convertFx(): New function! Easy conversion between the life table indicators;
- MortalityLaws(): Remove scale.x argument. Now, the function will identify
by default which laws require a scaled x in fitting;
- MortalityLaws(): When a mortality law is fitted on a subset of the input data,
using fit.this.x argument, the residuals and fitted values are computed and plotted for
the entire age range (in input). Previously only the fitted values followed this
approach;
- MortalityLaw(): set the argument `show = FALSE` as default;
- Drop `diagram` suggestion from DESCRIPTION and vignettes.

version 1.5.0
- LawTable(): Compute life tables from parameters of a mortality law;
- Fix bug in the ReadHMD() function due to HMD migration from http to https.

version 1.4.0
- Compute e[x] at the beginning of the age interval in LifeTable(). This affects only the ex column in the life table, all the other indicator remain unchanged;
- New mortality model: Gamma-Gompertz (Vaupel.1979 version);
- Fix bug related to fit.this.x argument in MortalityLaws();
- More rigorous referencing in avalaibleLaws() function.

version 1.3.0
- Add generic functions: deviance, df.residual;
- Update vignette.

version 1.2.0
- Vignettes;
- Fix predict.MortalityLaws bug for cases where the input is of class matrix;
- Solution for 'Kostaki' inflexion point due to high correlation between estimated parameters;
- Add 'scale.x' argument in MortalityLaw function;
- Add 'ax' argument in LifeTable function;
- Add 'show' argument in ReadHMD function;
- Other minor changes.

version 1.0.5
- Fix issues with minpack.lm not being imported.

version 1.0.0:
- First stable version (on CRAN).
