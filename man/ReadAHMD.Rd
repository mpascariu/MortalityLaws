\details{
(Description taken from the AHMD website).

The Australian Human Mortality Database (AHMD) was created to provide
detailed Australian mortality and population data to researchers, students,
journalists, policy analysts, and others interested in the history of
human longevity. The project is an achievement of the Mortality,
Ageing & Health research team in the ANU School of Demography under the
supervision of Associate Professor Vladimir Canudas-Romo, in collaboration
with demographers at the Max Plank Institute for Demographic Research
(Rostock, Germany) and the Department of Demography, University of
California at Berkeley.

The AHMD is a "satellite" of the Human Mortality Database (HMD),
an international database which currently holds detailed data for multiple
countries or regions. Consequently, the AHMD's underlying methodology
corresponds to the one used for the HMD.

The AHMD gathers all required data (deaths counts, births counts,
population size, exposure-to-risk, death rates) to compute life tables
for Australia, its states and its territories. One of the great advantages
of the database is to include data that is validated and corrected, when
required, and rendered comparable, if possible, for the period ranging
from 1971 thru 2016. For comparison purposes, various life tables published
by governmental organizations are also available for download in PDF format.
