\details{
The Human Mortality Database (HMD) was created to provide detailed mortality
and population data to researchers, students, journalists, policy analysts,
and others interested in the history of human longevity. The project began
as an outgrowth of earlier projects in the Department of Demography at the
University of California, Berkeley, USA, and at the Max Planck Institute for
Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany (see history). It is the work of two
teams of researchers in the USA and Germany (see research teams), with the
help of financial backers and scientific collaborators from around the world
(see acknowledgements). The Center on the Economics and Development of Aging
(CEDA) French Institute for Demographic Studies (INED) has also supported the
further development of the database in recent years.
