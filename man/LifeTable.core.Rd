\usage{
LifeTable.core(x, Dx, Ex, mx, qx, lx, dx, sex, lx0, ax)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of ages at the beginning of the age interval.}

\item{Dx}{Object containing death counts. An element of the \code{Dx} object
represents the number of deaths during the year to persons aged x to x+n.}

\item{Ex}{Exposure in the period. \code{Ex} can be approximated by the
mid-year population aged x to x+n.}

\item{mx}{Life table death rate in age interval [x, x+n).}

\item{qx}{Probability of dying in age interval [x, x+n).}

\item{lx}{Probability of survival up until exact age x (if l(0) = 1), or
the number of survivors at exact age x, assuming l(0) > 1.}

\item{dx}{Deaths by life-table population in the age interval [x, x+n).}

\item{sex}{Sex of the population considered here. Default: \code{NULL}.
This argument affects the first two values in the life table ax column.
If sex is specified the values are computed based on the Coale-Demeny method
and are slightly different for males than for females.
Options: \code{NULL, male, female, total}.}

\item{lx0}{Radix. Default: 100 000.}

\item{ax}{Numeric scalar. Subject-time alive in age-interval for those who
die in the same interval. If \code{NULL} this will be estimated. A common
assumption is \code{ax = 0.5}, i.e. the deaths occur in the middle of
the interval. Default: \code{NULL}.}
