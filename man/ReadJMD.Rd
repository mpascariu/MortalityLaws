\details{
(Description taken from the JMD website).

The Japanese Mortality Database is a comprehensively-reorganized mortality
database that is optimized for mortality research and consistent with the
Human Mortality Database. This database is provided as a part of the research
project "Demographic research on the causes and the socio-economic
consequence of longetivity extension in Japan" (2011-2013), "Demographic
research on longevity extension, population aging, and their effects on the
social security and socio-economic structures in Japan" (2014-2016), and
"Comprehensive research from a demographic viewpoint on the longevity
revolution" (2017-2019) at the National Institute of Population and Social
Security Research.

The Japanese Mortality Database is designed to provide the life tables to all
the people who are interested in Japanese mortality including domestic and
foreign mortality researchers for the purpose of mortality research.
Especially because we have structured it to conform with the HMD, our
database is suitable for international comparison, we put emphasis on the
compatibility with the HMD more than our country's particular
characteristics. Therefore, the life tables by JMD do not necessarily
exhibit the same values as ones by the official life tables prepared and
released by the Statistics and Information Department, Minister's
Secretariat, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare according to the different
base population or the methods for estimating the tables. When doing things
other than mortality research, if life table that statistically displays our
country's mortality situation is necessary, please use the official life
table that has been prepared by the Statistics and Information Department,
Minister's Secretariat, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

At the present time, we offer the data for All Japan and by prefecture.
The project team is studying the methodology for estimating life tables
along with data preparation. Therefore, the data may be updated when a
new methodology is adopted. Please refer to "Methods" for further
information.
