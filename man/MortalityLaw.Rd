\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of ages at the beginning of the age interval.}

\item{Dx}{Object containing death counts. An element of the \code{Dx} object 
represents the number of deaths during the year to persons aged x to x+n.}

\item{Ex}{Exposure in the period. \code{Ex} can be approximated by the 
mid-year population aged x to x+n.}

\item{mx}{Death rate in age interval [x, x+n).}

\item{qx}{Probability of dying in age interval [x, x+n).}

\item{law}{The name of the mortality law/model to be used. e.g. 
\code{gompertz}, \code{makeham}, ... To investigate all the possible options, 
see \code{\link{availableLaws}} function.}

\item{opt.method}{How would you like to find the parameters? Specify the 
function to be optimize. Available options: the Poisson likelihood function 
\code{poissonL}; the Binomial likelihood function -\code{binomialL}; and 
6 other loss functions. For more details, check the \code{\link{availableLF}} 
function.}

\item{parS}{Starting parameters used in the optimization process (optional).}

\item{fit.this.x}{Select the ages to be considered in model fitting. By default 
\code{fit.this.x = x}. One may want to exclude from the fitting procedure, say, the 
advanced ages where the data is sparse.}

\item{scale.x}{Logical. Scale down \code{"x"} vector so that it begins with 
a small value. This is useful in order to obtain meaningful estimates and 
sometimes a better fit. Default: \code{FALSE}. Method: \code{new.x = x - min(x) + 1}.}

\item{custom.law}{Allows you to fit a model that is not defined 
in the package. Accepts as input a function.}

\item{show}{Choose whether to display a progress bar during the fitting process. 
Logical. Default: \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
The output is of the \code{"MortalityLaw"} class with the components:

\item{input}{List with arguments provided in input. Saved for convenience.}

\item{info}{Brief information about the model.}

\item{coefficients}{Estimated coefficients.}

\item{fitted.values}{Fitted values of the selected model.}

\item{residuals}{Deviance residuals.}

\item{goodness.of.fit}{List containing goodness of fit measures like 
AIC, BIC and log-Likelihood.}

\item{opt.diagnosis}{Resultant optimization object useful for 
checking the convergence etc.}

\item{stats}{List containing statistical measures like: 
parameter correlation, standard errors, degrees of freedom, deviance, 
gradient matrix, QR decomposition, covariance matrix etc.}
}
\description{
Fit parametric mortality models given a set of input data which can be 
represented by death counts and mid-interval population estimates \code{(Dx, Ex)}
or age-specific death rates \code{(mx)} or death probabilities \code{(qx)}. 
Using the argument \code{law} one can specify the model to be fitted. 
So far 27 parametric models have been implemented; check the \code{\link{availableLaws}}
function to learn about the available options. The models can be fitted under 
the maximum likelihood methodology or by selecting a loss function to be 
optimised. See the implemented loss function by running the
\code{\link{availableLF}} function.
}
\details{
Depending on the complexity of the model, one of following optimization 
strategies is employed: 
\enumerate{
\item{Nelder-Mead method:}{ approximates a local optimum of a problem with n
 variables when the objective function varies smoothly and is unimodal. 
 For details see \code{\link{optim}}}
\item{PORT routines:}{ provides unconstrained optimization and optimization 
subject to box constraints for complicated functions. For details check 
\code{\link{nlminb}}}
\item{Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm:}{ damped least-squares method. 
For details check \code{\link{nls.lm}}}

# hx = b*exp(b*(x-m)) (here b and m are the parameters to be estimated)
