\details{
(Description taken from the CHMD website).

The Canadian Human Mortality Database (CHMD) was created to provide detailed
Canadian mortality and population data to researchers, students, journalists,
policy analysts, and others interested in the history of human longevity.
The project is an achievement of the Mortality and Longevity research team at
the Department of Demography, Universite de Montreal, under the supervision
of Professor Robert Bourbeau, in collaboration with demographers at the
Max Plank Institute for Demographic Research (Rostock, Germany) and the
Department of Demography, University of California at Berkeley.
Nadine Ouellette, researcher at the Institut national d'etudes demographiques
in Paris and member of the Mortality and Longevity research team at the
Universite de Montreal, is in charge of computing all CHMD life tables and
updating the CHMD web site.

The CHMD is a "satellite" of the Human Mortality Database (HMD), an
international database which currently holds detailed data for multiple
countries or regions. Consequently, the CHMD's underlying methodology
corresponds to the one used for the HMD.

The CHMD gathers all required data (deaths counts, births counts, population
size, exposure-to-risk, death rates) to compute life tables for Canada,
its provinces and its territories. One of the great advantages of the
database is to include data that is validated and corrected, when required,
and rendered comparable, if possible, for the period ranging from 1921
thru 2011. For comparison purposes, various life tables published by
governmental organizations are also available for download in PDF format.

# Download demographic data for Quebec and Saskatchewan regions in 1x1 format

# Death counts. We don't want to export data outside R.

# Download life tables for female population. To export data use save = TRUE.
LTF <- ReadCHMD(what = "LT_f",
